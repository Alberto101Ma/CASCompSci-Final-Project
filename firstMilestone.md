# First Milestone Questions



### 1. What is the current goal of your project?
My current goal is for a user to type in the subreddit they want to access (like last year's project), and the app will display the posts (including images) that subreddit. If I have time, I would also like to incorperate a Twitter feature.


### 2. What have you accomplished so far toward that goal?
So far, I am able to display an image from a URL and display it back on XCode (this achieved with a program called Pods, which lets me use other github projects from other people). The program also prints back the json of the Reddit site PrequelMemes, and my goal now is to able to show the reddit images, using the URL's in the json file. I'm very happy that instead of relying on a wrapper (like last year), it's nice to be able to get a lot of the information from Reddit myself with json.



### 3. What do we need to know if we want to run your project in its current state? For example, maybe this app can only be run on your phone, not in Simulator. Or maybe there are a couple of bugs that the user needs to avoid for now.

In the current state, the app doesn't have many features (only 1 feature to be exact). All it does so far is display a SINGLE image from reddit (which I implemented, just to )



### 4. What percentage of your goal would you estimate you have completed? Measure this in time spent working on the project so far and the amount of time you estimate you would need in order to complete the project. So if, for example, you've worked 10 hours on this project and you think it would take 15 more hours to complete it, then you are 40% of the way done.

I would say that around 35-40% of the project is completed (although not much code was written, there was a lot of research involved as well as review of the old json topic).  That is just my estimation, however. Depending on how fast I am able to overcome my biggest challenge, this percentage might move accordingly.


### 5. What is the most significant achievement you've made so far on this project? This could be something you built (a feature of the app) or the way that you built it (the way your code is written).

So far, the most significanct achievement I made was adding the ability to show a picture from the URL (although I did use a source code, I did have to research how to implement Pods).



### 6. What do you anticipate being the hardest part of the remainder of your project?
Since the JSON file itself contains many different objects named with many different names, I think a challenge will be to extract JUST the URLs that end with .JPGS, so that way I can transfer it to the program that displays the image from that URL.
