# Annotated Bibliography

This is a list of resources that I have come across while working on this project.

### Reddit Wrapper

[Link](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/reddift)

Although this code was very complicated (containing many fiiles), it was the first source I found. I won't use this source much, unfortunately.


### Another Reddit Wrapper

[Link](https://github.com/sonsongithub/reddift)

As another reddit wrapper that I found, this one was perhaps a lot more useful. I can use it as an example on how the reddit side of the API can operate.



### Twitter Wrapper

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ixsaChnjnc&t=1059s)

This is the link to a YouTube video that explores Twitter side of the API. The video also explains the topic of a "key", which is needed in the first place to access Twitter.



### Twitter Header

[Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fcf9yFe944)
[Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZCoLepLu0w)

These two YouTube video (has a part one and two) shows how to create a table using  LBTAComponents, allowing a different table for different users.



### Log-in Screen

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HN7usMROt8&t=4684s)

This Log-in YouTube video probably serve beyond the scope of this project, but I was extremely interested in learning  how to log-in in a database, as well as creating some of the front-end, as well as handeling the errors.



### Podfile Installation Video

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuMZZtQpB6Y)

This is an installation video for a program called Podfile. Podfile allows me to import code from other people, such as the github project right below (Kingfisher).



### Kingfisher
[Link](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher)

Kingfisher is an extremely cool program that allows to import images to Swift, using just the URL.


### String Ends With (Swift)

[Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32967445/how-to-check-what-a-string-starts-with-prefix-or-ends-with-suffix-in-swift)

Although it is a simple concept, this stackoverflow page teaches the syntax to check the prefix/suffix of a string



### Json Parsing
[Link](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/json-parsing-decoding/)

Even though it kind of serves as a review from the JSON unit covered earlier this year, this article does refresh some memory on the topic, as well as provide some extra information (like formatting)


### Json Parsing Video
[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZS-eeO9YoU)

This YouTube video, kind of like the link above, shows how to parse JSON data, however in a video.

### Another video

Another parsing video (more complicated JSON this time)
