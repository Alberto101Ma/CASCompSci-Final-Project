# Annotated Bibliography

This is a list of resources that I have come across while working on this project.

### Reddit Wrapper

Although this code was very complicated (containing many fiiles), it was the first source I found. I won't use this source much, unfortunately.


### Another Reddit Wrapper

As another reddit wrapper that I found, this one was perhaps a lot more useful. I can use it as an example on how the reddit side of the API can operate.
