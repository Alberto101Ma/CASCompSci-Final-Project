# Second Milestone

## What was the original goal of your project?

The original goal was to display reddit thumbnails from a search by the user.

## How have the goals of your project changed?

The goals of my project haven't changed that much over the course of the project. However, over the course of the project, I did not expect the major focus to go in figuring out how to find access nested JSON.

## What is a significant thing that you learned while building this project?

While building the project, one significant thing I learned while building the project is how to extract JSON that is nested, and then using codables. I nearned the difficulty of trying extract nested objects inside of JSON, and then creating a class with Codables that later gets the nested JSON, and can later be accessed in the ViewController itself.
By creating a class that accesses the JSON, it can very be easily accessed later.

## Describe an unexpected challenge that came up during this project, and how you overcame it.

Other then the nested JSON issue, I definately had a lot of unexpected challenges. When starting this project, I had little idea of "how" I wanted to extract information from Reddit, and even if I wanted to do Reddit at all. So, firstly, I had the problem of finding how I was going to do the project in the first place. Secondly, another challenge I came up with was accessing an image from the JSON.

## Knowing what you know now, if you were to rebuild this project completely from scratch, what would you do differently, and why?

If I was going to re-build the project (I might fix this before the due date, I'm not sure), I will probably find a way to access the images from the JSON myself, if possible, without relying on other people's code. The project is definately a challenge, especially since I'm not rellying on a wrapper like last year, but I still shouldn't use other people's code, especially since the whole project will break due to the dependence.
